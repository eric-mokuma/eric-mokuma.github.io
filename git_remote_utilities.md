# "Git remote" Utility

Using the *"git remote"* function in Git, you can manage "git remote" repositories related to your local repository. It allows you to list, add, remove, or modify references to remote dépôts. For example, git remote -v displays the URLs of configured remote repositories, whereas git remote add origin <url> adds a new remote repository called "origin". You can use Git Remote to configure connections to remote storage sites such as GitHub or GitLab or to update the data associated with these connections.
