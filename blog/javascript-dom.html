        <em><u>Javascript in simple word</u></em> is a computer language that
        makes web pages interactive. It runs in web browsers and enables
        developers to generate dynamic content, manage user interactions, and
        change the appearance of online pages in real time. It is necessary for
        developing contemporary websites and online apps.

        <em><u>What is DOM</u></em> to put it simply, DOM is an HTML file that
        is used with Javascript.
      </p>
      <p>
        The browser provides a Javascript document called "tree" with several
        properties and methods for precise functionality.

        <p>
          JavaScript methods are functions defined within JavaScript objects.
          They are actions that can be performed on objects. In simpler terms,
          methods are functions that are associated with an object, and they can
          either manipulate the object's data or perform operations related to
          the object.

        <u><li>JavaScript Sub-object</li></u>
        <p>
          A JavaScript Object is a container that stores the object's properties
          as a key-value pair. An object's properties are accessible using
          either dot notation or square bracket notation. Nested or cascaded
          items are those that contain other things within themselves. To access
          the value in nested objects, use consecutive dot or square bracket
          syntax.

          "Sub-object," meaning an item that is an attribute of another object.

        <p>
          Properties are the features or attributes of an object in JavaScript.
          In essence, they are variables that are affixed to things. Every
          property has a matching value and a name, or key. In JavaScript,
          objects are collections of key-value pairs, where a property name is
          the key and its value is the value.
