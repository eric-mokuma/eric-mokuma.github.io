            Pentest. This path aligns perfectly with my passion for protecting
            and safeguarding digital systems.

            Transportation poses a significant challenge that could impact my
            learning journey during the bootcamp. The complex and time-consuming
            commute, involving multiple modes of transportation, will require
            careful planning and flexibility to ensure timely arrival at the
            bootcamp venue.

            The early morning drop-off of my two-year-old child adds an
            additional layer of stress and potential delays. The unpredictable
            nature of childcare and traffic conditions could disrupt my schedule
            and affect my ability to focus during the first hours of class.
            Moreover, the extended commute time limits my opportunities for
            extra study or networking outside of bootcamp hours.

          <p>
            As an administrative assistant at a United Nations under-traitance
            company over a decade ago, I encountered a dilemma involving a
            conflict of interest. Upon joining the FUEL UNIT department, I
            observed that the cleaner, who happened to be my superior's
            girlfriend, was underperforming in her duties. Driven by a desire to
            improve the efficiency of our workplace, I sought to understand the
            underlying reasons behind her lackluster performance.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, my inquiry was met with resistance, as my superior's
            personal relationship with the cleaner created a barrier to
            objective evaluation. Despite my attempts to address the issue
            professionally, the conflict escalated, creating an uncomfortable
            and strained work environment. The situation forced me to question
            my actions and the impact they had on my colleagues and the overall
            workplace dynamics.
          </p>

          <p>
            Upon discovering that the woman was romantically involved with the
            chef, I felt a surge of trepidation for my own position within the
            company. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, securing employment is
            an arduous task, and the prospect of losing my job filled me with
            anxiety. Given the intimate nature of our workplace, I recognized
            the need to devise a swift and discreet solution to address the
            situation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Despite my initial attempts to encourage the woman to uphold her
            professional obligations, my efforts proved futile. Recognizing the
            potential conflict of interest and the implications it could have on
            the workplace dynamics, I discreetly reached out to the human
            resources department. I respectfully requested that she be
            transferred to a different department, believing that this would
            mitigate any potential biases or favoritism that could arise from
            her personal relationship with the chef.
