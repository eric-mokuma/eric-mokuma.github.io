          <u><h2>Neuroplasticity</h2></u>
          <p class="text"><em>Neuroplasticity</em> refers to the ability of neurons to change and remodel during their lives.</p>
          <p class="text">Research suggests that resilience is linked to cerebral plasticity, or neuroplasticity, which refers to 
            the brain's ability to reorganise and restructure in response to environmental changes. Individuals' brain 
            plasticity can be stimulated by consistent training and the repetition of new behaviours. Neuroscience helps 
            us understand the underlying mechanisms of resilience by investigating how the brain handles and regulates 
            stress and emotions.</p>

          <u><h2>The principles of neuroplasticity</h2></u>
          <p class="text">Mobilise all of his senses at the same time in order to remember more effectively. Sleep before and after 
            training to help retain information. Bouger because physical activity contributes to neuronal health and 
            neurogenesis. Connect and repeat the facts to improve memorization.

          <u><h2>Growth Mindset</h2></u>
          <p class="text">A growth mindset is the concept that one's abilities and skills can be enhanced via hard work, learning, and 
            receiving feedback.</p>
          <p class="text">I recognised that my drive is critical to my success in the realm of coding. I know my goals and I know they 
            are realistic; I consider my mistakes, my challenges as learning opportunities and I must practice, practice
            and practice in order for my neurons to get used to and develop in this new activity.

            <p class="text">setting my goals will help me stay motivated and constantly move towards improving skills and knowledge, 
              keeping a positive attitude towards challenges and mistakes will allow me to see them as learning opportunities 
              rather than obstacles, thus promoting my personal development.</p>
