          <h1>A Personal Transformation at the Heart of Learning</h1>

          <p>
            At first, I thought this adventure would be easy. I was convinced
            that my personal motivation would be enough to overcome all
            obstacles. However, I quickly realized that this wasn’t the case.
            While motivation is essential, it alone couldn’t carry me through my
            journey. What truly allowed me to progress was the method of
            positive feedback, both in receiving and offering constructive
            comments. Thanks to this approach, I was able to improve and achieve
            milestones I never thought possible.
          </p>
          <span>The Importance of Human Skills</span>
          <p>
            It became clear to me that my motivation, although important, was
            not sufficient. I needed something more concrete to help me navigate
            the complexities of human relationships. This "something" was the
            knowledge of human skills. These skills encompass a variety of
            methods and techniques we learned during our foundational training
            and bootcamp. They include effective communication, active
            listening, empathy, and collaboration. They are essential in today’s
            world, where social interaction is at the core of almost all
            professional and personal successes.
          </p>
          <span>A Profound Impact</span>
          <p>
            By deepening my knowledge in this area, I discovered the importance
            of personal and collective well-being. I learned to live better in
            society, to interact constructively with others, and these new
            skills had a direct impact on my family life. I now feel more in
            tune with my family members, able to establish open and sincere
            dialogues, which has strengthened our bonds. Communication, once
            tamed, has become a valuable tool for easing tensions and fostering
            a positive atmosphere at home.
          </p>
          <span>Preparing for the Next Step</span>
          <p>
            Today, I feel ready to tackle the next stage of my journey:
            beginning my training in cybersecurity. This field deeply interests
            me, not only for its technical challenges but also for the
            importance of digital security in our current society. The
            transition to this new domain wouldn’t be possible without the
            foundation of human skills I have acquired. I now understand that
            cybersecurity is not just about technology; it also requires the
            ability to work in teams, communicate clearly, and solve problems
            collaboratively.
          </p>
          <span>Recognitions and Thanks</span>
          <p>
            I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Josh Bruse, who had
            the idea that I could join Dev Academy. This opportunity has changed
            my life. I also thank all my facilitators, whose commitment and
            support have allowed me to grow. Every session, every exercise, and
            every moment of sharing contributed to my personal and professional
            development. My colleagues from Mako-Kotare-2024 also played a
            crucial role in this journey. Their presence, encouragement, and
            exchanges enriched me, pushing me to give my best.
          </p>
          <span>A Vision for the Future</span>
          <p>
            Looking ahead, I am driven by a new vision. I aspire to use the
            skills I have acquired not only to succeed in the field of
            cybersecurity but also to continue growing as an individual. I wish
            to remain engaged in developing my human skills, as I firmly believe
            that they are key to building strong relationships and a harmonious
            work environment.
          </p>
          <span>Conclusion</span>
          <p>
            In summary, my journey has been a true revelation. I’ve learned that
            motivation is a driving force, but human skills are the necessary
            fuel to move forward. By integrating these elements into my life, I
            now feel capable of facing new challenges with confidence. My
            experience at Dev Academy has been more than just technical
            learning; it has been a springboard for personal transformation. I
            am now ready to embrace the future, fortified by my knowledge and
            driven by a desire to learn even more. A new chapter is beginning,
            and I can’t wait to see where it leads me.
