        <p>A webpage is constructed using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). 
          According to my understanding, HTML serves as the foundation of a
        web page by utilising tags, and an HTML tag consists of an opening
        tag and a closing tag, both of which include an element.</p></div>

        <p>Cascading style sheets, or CSS, are used to style and beautify
        webpages</p>
      <p>Some CSS conceptes:</p>
      <ul  id="conceptes">
        <li><em>Margin</em>: Margin is used to create space around elements that do not have defined borders.</li>
        <li><em>Border</em>: The CSS border properties allow you to specify the style, width, and color of an element's border</li>
        <li><em>Padding</em>: Padding is the space between the content and the border of an element.</li>
        <li><em>Class</em>: CSS Classes Overview, allows simultaneous styling of multiple HTML elements.</li>
        <li><em>Ids</em>: The id selector is utilized to choose a single unique element on a page since the id of an element is exclusive to that page. By using the id selector, you can specifically target a singular element on a page due to the uniqueness of its id within that page.</li>
        <li><em>positions</em>: The position property in CSS determines where an element is located within a document.</li>
        <li><em>display</em>: 1. The display CSS property determines how an element is treated, either as a block or inline box, and also specifies the layout for its children, such as flow layout, grid, or flex.</li>
      </ul>
