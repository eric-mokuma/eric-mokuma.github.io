        <em><u>STUCK ON A SIMPLE PROBLEM,</u></em> I read the PseudoCode many
        times before using the rubber duck approach, which helped me see what I
        had overlooked. In the KATA 4 Gradebook Challenge, each student's
        gradebook must be added, and their score must match an array. I had only
        neglected to find each student's array's location in respect to their
        name.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this time, I felt broken, weary, and powerless because I had
        wasted so much time, so I decided to leave and go to bed because it was
        late. I kept thinking about the bit of code I had left behind as I
        slept. I planned to test a few of these ideas in the morning, and when I
        got in front of the machine for the first time, it worked.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then, I've learnt one thing: when you're stuck, you should either
        go for a stroll (walk, run, bike), or take a break and return later.

        <em><u>Pseudocode</u></em>
        is a method of describing code that combines basic, natural language and
        programming language features.

      <p>
        <em><u>Benefits of writing pseudo-code</u></em> The following are the
        principal advantages that novice or seasoned developers may get from
        using pseudo-code:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em><u>IMPROVED EFFICIENCY</u></em
          >: Developers can save time by preparing their code before delving
          into the specifics or syntax of a particular programming language, and
          then expressing the phases of the process in pseudo-code. This can
          lessen the need for debugging and help programmers avoid mistakes.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <em><u>EASIER TO READ</u></em
          >: It is simpler for developers to read and comprehend pseudo-code
          since it is written in a way that is easily understood by everyone,
          especially when working in a team or reviewing older code.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <em><u>GREATER FLEXIBILITY</u></em
          >: Because pseudo-code is not limited to a single programming
          language, it may be simply ported to other languages. This tool is
          beneficial for developers that utilise many languages and need to
          translate their ideas.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <em><u>IMPROVED COLLABORATION</u></em
          >: Pseudo-code can be used as a shared language among developers to
          communicate and cooperate on a project. Pseudo-code helps developers
          to explain their ideas simply and concisely, making it very beneficial
          for collaborative projects.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <em><u>LOCAL MANAGEMENT</u></em
          >: Because it is not executable, your pseudo-code does not need to be
          hosted online or linked to external scripts, like a full-fledged
          programme does. It may be produced and saved as a local file, a cloud
          file, or even an email.
        </li>
        <br />
      </ul>

        <em><u>Rubber ducky method</u></em
        >, This code debugging approach entails discussing an issue aloud to a
        rubber duck. In our instance, it's a programming challenge complete with
        all the specifics.
